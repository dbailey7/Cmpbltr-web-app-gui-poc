Greetings,

Making use of this repo whould be straight forward ... just drop it in a folder on your local machine, 
change directory to the directory that contains the index.js file, and runthe app via "node index.js".

The app covers creating accounts, logging in to accounts, capturing logs, and doing rule selection from 
a multi-select checkbox.

Obviously you need to have node installed, as well.

Ping me if youhave any questions that are not answered by just "following your nose" through the above.

Cheers,

David
