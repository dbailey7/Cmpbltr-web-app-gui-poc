Greetings,

Making use of this repo should be straight forward ... just drop it in a folder on your local machine, 
change directory to the directory that contains the index.js file, and run the app via "node index.js".

The app covers creating accounts, logging in to accounts, capturing logs, and doing rule selection from 
a multi-select checkbox.

Obviously you need to have node installed, as well.

Ping me if you have any questions that are not answered by just "following your nose" through the above.

Cheers,

David

P.S. If you encounter a string beginning with "YOUR-", that means you must replace it with your own 
values, but only if you want to use the Stripe API (https://stripe.com/) and play around with its 
online payment processing modules.
